# fake\_braintree, a Braintree fake 

This version has been edited by me to support using Poltergeist. See
d39d967e5749d7702329cfe4029e78ffe22a9a85

This library is a way to test [Braintree](http://www.braintreepayments.com/)
code without hitting Braintree's servers. It uses
[Capybara::Server](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/server.rb)
to intercept all of the calls from Braintree's Ruby library and returns XML that
the Braintree library can parse. The whole point is not to hit the Braintree
API.


It supports a lot of Braintree methods, but it does not support every single one
of them (yet).

## Supported API methods

### Customer
* `Braintree::Customer.find`
* `Braintree::Customer.create` (including adding add-ons and discounts)
* `Braintree::Customer.update`
* `Braintree::Customer.delete`

### Subscription
* `Braintree::Subscription.find`
* `Braintree::Subscription.create`
* `Braintree::Subscription.update`
* `Braintree::Subscription.cancel`

### CreditCard
* `Braintree::CreditCard.find`
* `Braintree::CreditCard.sale`
* `Braintree::CreditCard.update`

### Transaction
* `Braintree::Transaction.sale`
* `Braintree::Transaction.refund`
* `Braintree::Transaction.void`

### TransparentRedirect
* `Braintree::TransparentRedirect.url`
* `Braintree::TransparentRedirect.confirm` (only for creating customers)

## Quick start
Just require the library and you're good to go:

    require 'fake_braintree'

`FakeBraintree.clear!` will clear all data, which you almost certainly want to
do before each test.

Full example:

    # spec/spec_helper.rb
    require 'fake_braintree'

    RSpec.configure do |c|
      c.before do
        FakeBraintree.clear!
      end
    end

If you're using Cucumber, add this too:

    # features/support/env.rb
    require 'fake_braintree'

    Before do
      FakeBraintree.clear!
    end

## Spork

To use fake\_braintree with Spork, do this:

    # Gemfile
    group :test do
      gem 'fake_braintree', :require => false
    end

    # spec/spec_helper.rb
    Spork.each_run do
      require 'fake_braintree'
      # ...other FakeBraintree configuration, for example:
      # FakeBraintree.verify_all_cards!
    end

    # features/support/env.rb
    Spork.each_run do
      require 'fake_braintree'
      # ...other FakeBraintree configuration, for example:
      # FakeBraintree.verify_all_cards!
    end


## Verifying credit cards

To verify every credit card you try to use, call:

    FakeBraintree.verify_all_cards!

This will stay "on" until you set

    FakeBraintree.verify_all_cards = false

Calling FakeBraintree.clear! _will not_ change this setting. It does very basic
verification: it only matches the credit card number against these:
http://www.braintreepayments.com/docs/ruby/reference/sandbox and rejects them if
they aren't one of the listed numbers.

## Declining credit cards

To decline every card you try, call:

    FakeBraintree.decline_all_cards!

This will decline all cards until you call

    FakeBraintree.clear!

This behavior is different from `FakeBraintree.verify_all_cards`, which will
stay on even when `clear!` is called.

Note that after `decline_all_cards!` is set, Braintree will still create
customers, but will not be able to charge them (so charging for e.g. a subscription
will fail). Setting `verify_all_cards!`, on the other hand, will prevent
creation of customers with bad credit cards - Braintree won't even get to trying
to charge them.

## Generating transactions

You can generate a transaction using `FakeBraintree.generate_transaction`. This
is for use in testing, e.g.
`before { user.transaction = FakeBraintree.generate_transaction }`.

It takes the following options:

* `:subscription_id`: the ID of the subscription associated with the transaction.
* `:created_at`: when the transaction was created (defaults to `Time.now`)
* `:amount`: the amount of the transaction
* `:status`: the status of the transaction, e.g. `Braintree::Transaction::Status::Failed`

Any or all of these can be nil, and in fact are nil by default. You can also
call it with no arguments.

Full example:

    transaction = FakeBraintree.generate_transaction(:amount => '20.00',
                                                     :status => Braintree::Transaction::Status::Settled,
                                                     :subscription_id => 'foobar',
                                                     :created_at => Time.now + 60)
    p transaction
    # {
    #   "status_history" =>
    #     [{
    #       "timestamp"  => 2011-11-20 12:57:25 -0500,
    #       "amount"     => "20.00",
    #       "status"     => "settled",
    #       "created_at" => 2011-11-20 12:58:25 -0500
    #     }],
    #   "subscription_id" => "foobar"
    # }
